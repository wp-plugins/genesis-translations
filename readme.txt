This plugin only works on the [Genesis Framework](http://forsitemedia.net/go/genesis/ "Genesis Framework").

== Installation ==

Installation of this plugin works like any other plugin out there. Either:

1. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or search for "Genesis Translations" via your plugins menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I see my language added to this plugin? =

[Please contact me](http://forsitemedia.net/contact/ "Please contact me") or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DeFries "My Twitter Account") and we'll get you sorted.

= Can I make a suggestion =

You most certainly can. [Please contact me](http://forsitemedia.net/contact/ "Please contact me") or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DeFries "My Twitter Account") and we'll get you sorted.

= Where can I find the list of languages being worked on? =

Visit the [StudioPress GlotPress installation](http://translate.studiopress.com/projects/genesis-framework/genesis-18 "GlotPress installation") to see the complete list of languages being worked on.

= I have your plugin activated but I don't see an options page =

That's because there isn't any. If you have one of the provided languages properly configured in your `wp-config.php` file, then upon activation you should see all matters Genesis automagically translated.

= When I've activated your plugin there are still some words in English on my site =

Most likely you either have words hardcoded in your child theme's `functions.php` file or you're working with outdated (or incomplete) WordPress translation.
